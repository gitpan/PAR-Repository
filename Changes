Revision history for Perl extension PAR::Repository.

0.14     Sat Nov  4 22:47 2006
    - Fixed a bug during injection.
    - META.yml now conforms to spec. 1.20.
    - Now including t/00podcover.t

0.13     Fri Sep 15 10:50 2006
    - Broke out PAR::Repository::Query into its own distribution
      so that PAR::Repository and PAR::Repository::Client can share
      the same querying interface.
    - Slight change to the interface!
      modules_dbm(), symlinks_dbm(), and scripts_dbm() now all return
      the name of the temporary file as second return value in order
      to make *_dbm() work consistently across PAR::Repository::Query
      uses.
