ToDo list
---------

General:
- Security?

PAR::Repository:

- implement querying (mostly done)
==> query arch

- implement checksums?
==> done
----> in Client::HTTP, the checksums should be fetched as data, not as a file.

- implement scanning for pure-perl modules?
See "sub getpurity" from CPANdeps: http://drhyde.cvs.sourceforge.net/drhyde/perlcpandeps/lib/CPANdeps.pm?view=markup
==> Done in PAR::Dist::FromCPAN


PAR:

--> use PAR { repository => 'http://foo/', run => 'foo.pl', upgrade => 1 };
==> Same, but check for updates and install permanently.

option logic: (Done except for "upgrade")
file => 'foo' || repository => 'foo'
fallback => 1|0 (1 default for repo, 0 default for file)
install => 1|0 or upgrade => 1|0 only for repository?

PAR::Repository::Client:

(DONE) - basic upgrading

- code for upgrading ==> checksums?
- "update" mode needs to deal with dists that are no longer available.
